## Overview

A simple app that allows users to search for gifs by term using the [GiphyAPI](https://developers.giphy.com/). There are a pre-set list of buttons that display for a set of actors. Users can add terms as they please. These will be stored in their local storage but they also have the ability to clear the local storage variables.
